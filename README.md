ðŸ§  Project Description: Chain-of-Thought Solver
Chain-of-Thought Solver is a smart web application that solves math and logic problems step-by-step by mimicking human-like reasoning. It uses the Groq API with LLaMA3, a powerful large language model, to generate detailed and explainable solutions using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.

I was guided in prompt engineering by Ashish Shetty sir from Testriq QA Lab, whose input helped improve the accuracy and clarity of the AIâ€™s step-by-step reasoning.

 Highlights:
Real-time AI solving using Groqâ€™s LLaMA3

Clean UI with TailwindCSS

Light/Dark theme toggle

Session-based login/logout

Dynamic problem history panel

FastAPI-powered backend with smooth frontend integration

Note: use your api key in main py so perfectÂ results
